## Project Architecture

**Estimatee-Mee** is a Figma widget for conducting estimation sessions (story points, planning poker) built with TypeScript and the Figma Widget API.

### Core Architecture

- **Entry Point**: `widget-src/code.tsx` registers the main Widget component
- **Component Structure**: Follows atomic design pattern (atoms/molecules/organisms)
- **State Management**: Uses Figma's `useSyncedState` and `useSyncedMap` for real-time collaboration
- **Session Flow**: waiting ‚Üí voting ‚Üí revealed states

### Key State Management

The widget uses Figma's synced state for real-time collaboration:

- `sessionStateData` (SessionState): Overall session status and participants
- `votes` (SyncedMap<Vote>): Individual user votes
- `participants` (SyncedMap<Participant>): Active users and their roles
- `activeUserIds`: List of currently active users (updated via polling)

### Component Hierarchy

```
Widget (organisms/widget.tsx)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WelcomeContent (molecules/) - Initial screen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VotingInterface (molecules/)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CardGrid (molecules/) - Fibonacci cards
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JokerCardGrid (molecules/) - Special cards (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, ‚òï, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ParticipantStatus (molecules/) - Shows voting progress
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FacilitatorControls (molecules/) - Reveal results button
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ResultsView (molecules/) - Vote results and summary
```

### Custom Hooks

- `useSessionState`: Manages session lifecycle and participant management
- `useVoting`: Handles vote submission and result grouping
- `useUserPolling`: Tracks active users and removes inactive participants

### Key Types

- `SessionState`: Session status, facilitator, and participants
- `Vote`: User vote with timestamp
- `Participant`: User info and spectator status
- `CardData`: Card configuration (value, emoji, tooltip)

## Figma Widget Specific

- Built for FigJam environment (`editorType: ["figjam"]`)
- Uses Figma Widget API v1.0.0
- Network access restricted to "none"
- Custom JSX configuration targets Figma's widget runtime

## Testing

**You should ensure tests pass before completing any task. If tests are failing due to unrelated changes, notify the user and ask whether you should fix them - don't ignore failing tests.**

### Test Commands

| Command                 | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `npm run test`          | Run all tests once                       |
| `npm run test:ui`       | Run tests with interactive UI            |
| `npm test -- watch`     | Run tests in watch mode                  |
| `npm test -- <pattern>` | Run specific test files matching pattern |

### Test Structure

- **Framework**: Vitest for fast unit testing
- **Configuration**: `vitest.config.ts`
- **Test Files**: Located alongside source files with `.test.ts` suffix
- **Coverage**: Tests cover hooks, utilities, and core functionality

### Test Categories

1. **Core Widget Tests** (`widget-src/code.test.ts`): Basic widget functionality
2. **Hook Tests** (`widget-src/hooks/`): State management and voting logic
3. **Utility Tests** (`widget-src/utils/`): Card gamification and vote processing
4. **Multi-user Tests**: Real-time collaboration scenarios

### When to Run Tests

- **Before committing**: Always run `npm run test` to ensure no regressions
- **After major changes**: Run full test suite to verify functionality
- **During development**: Use watch mode for immediate feedback
- **When debugging**: Run specific test files to isolate issues

### Test Expectations

- All tests must pass (72/72 tests currently passing)
- New features should include corresponding tests
- Tests should cover edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies (Figma API, user interactions)

## Build Output

- Source: `widget-src/` (TypeScript)
- Output: `dist/code.js` (compiled JavaScript)
- Manifest: `manifest.json` defines widget metadata
